Summary
A program that allows users to buy a limited number movie tickets. Each buyer can only purchase 4 movie tickets at a time. After all 20 movie tickets have been sold, the total number of buyers will be displayed.

Variables
* TOTALTICKETS
* MAXPERBUYER
* numOfBuyers
* numOfTickets

Functions
* main()

Design Process
1. Create the main() function with no arguments.
2. Initialize TOTALTICKETS, MAXPERBUYER, numOfBuyers within main() and set them equal to their respective values.
3. Write a while loop that will continue to run if there are some tickets left to sell.
4. Within the while loop, create the numOfTickets variable which will prompt the user to input the number of tickets they are buying and convert it into an integer.
5. Within the while loop, create an if/elif/else block that ensures that the user cannot purchase more than 4 tickets, enter a value less than 0, or cannot buy more tickets than are available. Output text in each case outlining why their input is invalid.
6. In the else block, subtract numOfTickets from TOTALTICKETS and increment numOfBuyers by 1.
7. Exit the while loop and print numOfBuyers.
8. Exit the main() block and call the main(function.
