Summary
A program that replicates the Magic 8 Ball toy by accepting a yes or no question from a user and responding with a random answer.
 
Variables
* responses
* answers
* keep_playing

Functions
* create_file
* ask_question

Design Process
1. From the random module, import the choice function to select a random element from a sequence.
2. Define the create_file() function which will create the 8ball_responses.txt file.
3. Use a context manager to open the 8ball_responses.txt file in write-mode as the file-object responses.
4. Use the responses file-object write method to add all the possible responses. Ensure to add the newline character at the end of each response.
5. Exit the create_file() function.
6. Define the ask_question function that will use the 8ball_responses.txt file to generate a response to a user imposed question.
7. Initialize the answers variable and set it equal to an empty list.
8. Use a context manager to open the 8ball_responses.txt file in read-mode as the file-object responses.
9. Use a for loop on responses.readlines() to append each response to the answers list.
10.Initialize the keep_playing variable and set it equal to the string "Y".
11.Write a while loop with the condition of keep_playing == "Y".
12.Within the while loop, initialize the question variable and set it equal to the following: input("The Magic 8 Ball knows all. What is your question? ")
13.Print choice(answers) to display a random response to the user.
14.Reassign the value of keep_playing to the following: input("I have answered your question. Would you like to ask me another one? (Y/N) ")
15.Create an if statement with the following condition: keep_playing.upper() == "N". If the condition is true, then print an exit message and break the while loop.
16.Exit the ask_question() function and call create_file().
17.On the next line, call ask_question.
