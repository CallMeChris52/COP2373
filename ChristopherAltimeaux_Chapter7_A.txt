Summary
A program that allows the user to enter a series of sentences. It will then display each sentence and the number of sentences that were found.

Variables
* pat
* user_sentences
* sentences

Functions
* main()

Design Process
1. Import the regular expression module.
2. Define the main() function with no arguments.
3. Within the main() function, create a variable called pat with the following code:

pat = r"[A-Z\d].*?[.!?](?= [A-Z\d]|$)"

The variable pat holds a raw string that utilizes non-greedy expressions and the look ahead feature. This ensures that each individual sentence is captured between capital letters or numbers and punctuation marks.

4. Create the variable user_sentences that will prompt and store the user’s sentences using the input function.
5. Create the variable sentences using the following code:

sentences = re.findall(pat, user_sentences, flags= re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)

The re.findall() method returns a list that will store each substring that matches the pattern as its own element. The DOTALL flag ensures that all characters can be matched including /n and the MULTILINE flag allows the $ special character to match the beginning and end of strings and lines.

6. Write a print statement that will display the length of the sentences list.
7. Create a for loop that iterates through the sentences list and prints each sentence on a new line.
8. Exit the main() function and call main().
